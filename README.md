# React Frontend Template

A starting point for a static React frontend deployed to GitHub Pages.

- **Vite 8** + **React 18** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS 4** via `@tailwindcss/vite`, with theme tokens in [src/styles/index.css](src/styles/index.css)
- **Biome** for formatting, linting, and import sorting
- **Vitest** + **Testing Library** for unit and component tests
- **Playwright** suites for end-to-end, accessibility (axe), and Lighthouse checks
- **GitHub Actions** for CI, GitHub Pages deploys, and post-deploy Lighthouse audits

The committed app is a placeholder. Replace it with your own.

## Scripts

| Script                 | What it does                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`             | Vite dev server on port 5000                       |
| `pnpm build`           | Production build into `dist`                       |
| `pnpm preview`         | Build, then serve `dist`                           |
| `pnpm check`           | Format + lint + type check (app and Playwright)    |
| `pnpm test:unit`       | Vitest unit and component tests, once              |
| `pnpm test:unit:watch` | Vitest in watch mode                               |
| `pnpm test:e2e`        | End-to-end smoke tests                             |
| `pnpm test:a11y`       | axe scans, desktop and mobile viewports            |
| `pnpm test:lighthouse` | Lighthouse audits against the local preview server |
| `pnpm pw:open`         | Playwright UI mode                                 |
| `pnpm pw:report`       | Open the last HTML report                          |

The Playwright suites run against `vite preview`, so build first (`pnpm build`) and start it with `pnpm preview:ci`, or let CI do it.

## CI

- **CI** — lint, type check, unit tests, and the three Playwright suites on every push and PR
- **PR Reports** — changed-line count and bundle-size diff, posted as sticky comments on each PR
- **Deploy** — build and publish `dist` to GitHub Pages on the default branch
- **Production Lighthouse** — audits the live site 15 minutes after each deploy
